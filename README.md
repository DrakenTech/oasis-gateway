# Developer-gateway

The developer-gateway is a component that works along with the Oasis infrastructure to to provide a similar interface to other cloud services. It abstracts the semantics of account wallets typical from blockchains, and provides developers an interface to build applications against a blockchain but with a common user experience, as found in most internet web services.

## Build
In order to build the developer-gateway.

```
$ make
```

A binary `gateway` will be generated that is the gateway itself. In order to run the gateway,

```
./gateway
```
